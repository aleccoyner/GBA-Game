SpaceGame is a space game where the player is a rocket and the enemy is an alien. The alien bounces around the screen at an increasing rate based on the players score. If the player collides with the alien, the game is over and the game sends the user to the "WASTED" screen where the player can see their score and restart the game. It has all of the controls of a GBA, enter starts the game, delete resets the entire program, and the arrow keys move the player.
